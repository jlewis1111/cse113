Purpose: 
<Optional Section>

Pseduo-code:
None for this lab.

Conclusions:
a) What I learned from this lab:
I hate partner programming and asking for help. 

The buddy-partner system is a lie, setup, and gnarly whore pig in lipstick.
Wish I could smell the bacon; only sh!te here. 

Remote extensions to VS code are F@#king retarded from  a cyber security POV.

b) How did the pair programming help/hinder the lab:
It didn't hinder or help the lab. It was arbitrary af.


c) Issues and how I fixed them (bug report):
This was literally just Googling and testing code examples from search results and
following patterns in my source code. I borrowed from many sources. Online C compilers actually work.
I disabled my remote extensions in VS; but the f#%ker still won't function. Don't care to reinstall.

WIPING THE SHIT CLEAN AND STARTING FRESH SOON, SUNNY SON

I have restarted my system numerous times and am so done trying to make this thing work.
The VM I built previously on my personal workstation took a bloody shite on itself.
Same case on at least one other workstation I built on that I can think of on one user account in particular.
Online C compliers don't f@$^K with my S@#t as much as this stupid VM crap and remote extensions has/have.
 


d) Improvements that can be made:
Use these types of compilers, not the VS code crap:
